# Technical Hub — CREAPI + AI

**GovTech • AI • Analytics • Automation • Institutional Platforms**

This repository hosts the **CREAPI + AI Technical Hub**, a public technical documentation portal that presents architectural overviews, platform capabilities, and governance standards for analytical systems, AI engines, and institutional platforms developed for the CREA / CONFEA ecosystem.

The goal is to provide **public technical transparency** — including architecture, scope, and design standards — without exposing private source code or institutional data.

# Private Projects Transparency Standard

All documented platforms follow this principle:

> **Private Codebase — Public Technical Documentation**

Meaning:

- source code: private  
- business rules: private  
- credentials & connectors: private  
- **architecture, scope, and capabilities: public**

This ensures technical transparency without institutional risk exposure.
